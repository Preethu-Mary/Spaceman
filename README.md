# Spaceman Game

The Spaceman Game is a React-based implementation of the classic Hangman game. The objective is to guess a hidden word one letter at a time while keeping track of your wrong guesses. The game ends when the word is guessed correctly or when the number of allowed wrong guesses (7) is exceeded. This version uses animations to enhance the user experience.

## Features

- Guess the word by selecting letters from the on-screen keyboard.
- Track attempts, with a limited number of wrong guesses.
- Display messages when the game is won or lost, with sliding animations.
- Responsive layout and smooth animations using the [animate.css](https://animate.style/) library.

## Technologies Used

- **React** - JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Vite** - Fast build tool for React applications.
- **Vitest** - A fast and efficient testing framework for running unit and integration tests.
- **React Toastify** (optional) - Used for showing toast notifications (if you decide to keep it).
